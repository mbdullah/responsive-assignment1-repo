                    <p class="lorem-ipsum">Dr. Muhammad Yunus claimed that poverty is a threat to peace and confronting   poverty is a fight for human rights. A stable peace, he
                        said, must involve opportunities for people to live decent lives. While free market capitalism calls for one-dimensional
                        profit-maximization, Professor Yunus promoted Social Businesses whose primary goal is to look for solutions to solve
                        social problems. Human beings are infinitely creative and capable, and in the future, he predicts, poverty will only be
                        remembered in museums. “I firmly believe that we can create a poverty-free world if we collectively believe in it,” he
                        said.

                <p class="main-section-content-description">While the Internet speed in Bangladesh may not be among the fastest in the world, it has significantly improved in the recent past. As of July 2015, Bangladesh ranked 90th out of 198 countries on the Household Download Index by Net Index. Especially, the completion of the Kuakata submarine cable (Regional Submarine Telecommunications Project, Bangladesh) of BSCCL has added significant amount of transmission capacity (through SEA-ME-WE 5 Cable) and provided redundancy and low-latency with PoP to PoP connectivity.</p>

                        <p class="main-section-content-description">Expensive and slow connections available from individual homes has created a demand for cyber cafés with higher than average bandwidth. The number of cyber cafés was estimated to be roughly 800 in 2009, unchanged from 2005. Cyber cafés were first regulated by the BTRC in 2009, but fewer than 150 had obtained the required license by the end of 2011.</p>

                        <p class="main-section-content-description">In November and December 2015, the government blocked Facebook and other social media, for a period of twenty-two days. The purpose was to quell militant violence and opposition unrest as reactions to a death penalty to two opposition leaders, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Ali Ahsan Mujahid, for war crimes committed in the 1971 independence war.</p>
